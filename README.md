# Vector-Traits Crate

`vector-traits` is a Rust crate designed to provide a set of traits for abstracting over different vector 
implementations and scalar types, offering a unified interface for a basic set of vector operations. This crate facilitates 
seamless transitions between different vector libraries and scalar precisions (e.g., `f32` and `f64`) without 
requiring significant code modifications.

## Features

- Abstract over two-dimensional and three-dimensional vectors with `GenericVector2` and `GenericVector3` traits.
- Generic scalar trait `GenericScalar` for a flexible scalar type handling.
- Basic vector traits `HasXY` and `HasXYZ` for custom vector storage types, e.g., FFI types.
- Seamless transition between different vector libraries like `cgmath` and `glam`.
- Ability to switch between different scalar types (`f32`, `f64`) effortlessly.
- Optional `approx` feature for approximate equality checking through the `SimpleApprox` trait.

## Supported Vector Implementations

Currently, the following vector types from `cgmath` and `glam` libraries are supported:

- `glam::Vec2`
- `glam::DVec2`
- `glam::Vec3`
- `glam::DVec3`
- `cgmath::Vector2`
- `cgmath::Vector3`

## Usage

Add `vector-traits` to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies along with the desired features:

```toml
[dependencies]
vector-traits = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["glam", "cgmath", "approx"] }  # only use what you need
```
